                                        <li>Samples being taken, such as blood</li>

                                    <p>Interventional studies involve receiving a new treatment, for example physiotherapy or new drug, to assess the impacts. These studies are generally:</p>

                                        <li>'Randomised' – neither the patient nor researchers choose whether the patient gets the real treatment or the placebo.</li>

                                    <p>Qualitative research aims to understand more about people's experience of living with a condition. This type of research involves being asked questions or having an open discussion. You might be asked questions about anxiety, pain, or of doing day-to-day activities, for example. The research team will try to identify patterns to understand the issues faced by people living with scleroderma, and ways to tackle them.</p>

                                        <h5>What are trial phases?</h5>
                                        <p>Clinical trials testing new treatments are divided into different stages, called phases. The earliest phase trials may look at whether a drug is safe or the side effects it causes. Later phase trials aim to test whether a new treatment is better than existing treatments.</p>
                                        <p>There are 3 main phases of clinical trials – phases 1 to 3. Phase 1 trials are the earliest phase trials and phase 3 are later phase trials. </p>
                                        <p>Some trials have an earlier stage called phase 0, and there are some phase 4 trials done after a drug has been licensed.</p>
                                        <p>Some trials are randomised. This means the people taking part are put into one of the treatment groups at random. Doing this means the results are more reliable.</p>

                                        <h4>Phases 0 trials</h4>
                                        <p>Phase 1 trials are usually the earliest trials of drugs in people. But your doctor might ask if you would like to join a phase 0 study. These studies aim to find out if a drug behaves in the way researchers expect it to from their laboratory studies</p>
                                        <p>Phase 0 studies usually only involve a small number of people and they only have a very small dose of a drug. The dose of the drug is too small to treat your cancer, but you are also less likely to have side effects.</p>
                                        <p>Phase 0 trials aim to find out things such as
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>whether the drug reaches the cancer cells</li>
                                                <li>what happens to the drug in the body</li>
                                                <li>how cancer cells in the body respond to the drug</li>

                                        <p>Phase 1 is sometimes written as phase I. They are usually small trials, recruiting only a few patients. The trial may be open to people with any type of advanced cancer, usually those who have already had all other available treatments.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Phase 1 trials aim to find out:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>how much of the drug is safe to give</li>
                                                <li>what the side effects are</li>
                                                <li>what happens to the drug in the body</li>
                                                <li>if the treatment helps shrink the cancer</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Patients are recruited very slowly onto phase 1 trials. So even though they don't recruit many people, they can take a long time to complete. </p>
                                        <p>They are often dose escalation studies. This means that the first few patients that take part have a very small dose of the drug. If all goes well, the next few people have a slightly higher dose. And so on until they find the best dose to give. The researchers monitor the side effects people have and how they feel. </p>
                                    </div>
                                </Grid>
                                <div>
                                    <p>In a phase 1 trial you may have lots of blood tests because the researchers look at how your body copes with and gets rid of the drug. They carefully record any side effects you may have and when you have them.</p>
                                    <p>The main aim of phase 1 trials is to find out about doses and side effects. They need to do this first, before testing the potential new treatment to see if it works. Some people taking part may benefit from the new treatment, but many won't.</p>

                                        <p>These trials can be for people who all have the same type of cancer, or for people who have different types of cancer.</p>
                                        <p>Phase 2 trials aim to find out:

                                        <p>Phase 3 trials usually involve many more patients than phase 1 or 2. This is because differences in success rates may be small.</p>
